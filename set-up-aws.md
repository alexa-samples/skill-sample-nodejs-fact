    1. Follow the online instructions. Do not worry about the IAM role, we will do that later.
    2. You will need a Valid Credit Card to set up your account (note the AWS Free Tier will suffice however. [You can find out more about the free tier here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?sc_ichannel=ha&amp;sc_ipage=signin&amp;sc_iplace=body_link_text&amp;sc_icampaigntype=free_tier&amp;sc_icampaign=ha_en_free_tier_signin_2014_03).)
    3. Part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad.
    
2.  Sign in to the AWS Console

3.  It can sometimes take a couple minutes for your new AWS account to go live. You will receive an e-mail when your account is active.
