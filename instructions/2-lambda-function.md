## Setting Up A Lambda Function Using Amazon Web Services

In the [first step of this guide](./1-voice-user-interface.md), we built the Voice User Interface (VUI) for our Alexa skill.  On this page, we will be creating an AWS Lambda function using [Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com).  You can [read more about what a Lambda function is](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda), but for the purposes of this guide, what you need to know is that AWS Lambda is where our code lives.  When a user asks Alexa to use our skill, it is our AWS Lambda function that interprets the appropriate interaction, and provides the conversation back to the user.

1.  **Go to http://aws.amazon.com and sign in to the console.** If you don't already have an account, you will need to create one.  [If you don't have an AWS account, check out this quick walkthrough for setting it up](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/tree/master/aws/set-up-aws.md).

    [![Developer Console](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/2-1-sign-in-to-the-console._TTH_.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home)

2.  **Click "Services" at the top of the screen, and type "Lambda" in the search box.**  You can also find Lambda in the list of services.  It is in the "Compute" section.

3.  **Check your AWS region.** AWS Lambda only works with the Alexa Skills Kit in these regions: US East (N. Virginia), US West (Oregon), Asia Pacific (Tokyo)  and EU (Ireland).  Make sure you choose the region closest to your customers.

4.  **Click the orange "Create function" button.** It should be near the top of your screen.  (If you don't see this button, it is because you haven't created a Lambda function before.  Click the blue "Get Started" button near the center of your screen.)

5.  There are three boxes labeled "Author from scratch", "Blueprints" and "Serverless Application Repository". **Click the radio button in the box titled  "Serverless Application Repository"**  We have created a repository as a shortcut to getting everything set up for your skill.

6. **Search for the application repository named "alexa-skills-kit-nodejs-factskill".** You can find it using the provided search box.  

7. **Click on the repository.** This repository will create the Lambda function, add Alexa Skills Kit as it's trigger, and sets up an IAM role for you. It will also add the code from this GitHub repo and include it's dependencies to your Lambda function so that you don't have to upload it yourself.

8. **Click the deploy button** at the bottom of the page.

9. Wait for the status of all resources to change to **CREATE_COMPLETE**

10. Click the **Test App** button to go to the Lambda console.

11. **Open** the function that was **just created** by clicking on it.

12. If you want to **secure this Lambda function** follow the instructions found [here](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-cookbook/blob/master/aws/secure-lambda-function.md)

13. You should see the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) a unique identifier for this function in the top right corner of the page. **Copy the ARN value for this Lambda function** for use in the next section of the guide.
