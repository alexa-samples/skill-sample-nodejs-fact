## Setting up Your Alexa Skill in the Developer Console (Alexa Hosted)

With an Alexa-hosted skill, you can build, edit, and publish a skill without leaving the developer console.
The skill includes a code editor for managing and deploying the backend code for your skill.

 #### Build the Interaction Model for your skill

The Interaction Model for any skill lays the general guidelines of speech Alexa will listen for, including any additional information it may need to gather (ex: Slot Values). If you want to learn more about the Interaction Model and how it works, make sure to check out [the ASK Documentation on Creating an Interaction Model](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-the-interaction-model-for-your-skill.html).

- If you want to change the skill invocation name, select the **Build** tab, then **Invocation** under **Interaction Model**. Enter a **Skill Invocation Name**. This is the name that your users will need to say to start your skill.
- Click "Build Model".
