#  Build An Alexa Fact Skill 🇺🇸
<img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/fact/header._TTH_.png" />


This Alexa sample skill is a template for a basic fact skill. Provided a list of interesting facts about a topic, Alexa will select a fact at random and tell it to the user when the skill is invoked.

If you would like to see an example of this skill in action, you can enable the [Gloucester Facts](https://www.amazon.com/Robert-McCauley-Gloucester-Facts/dp/B01I5MOIA2/) from the [Alexa Skill Store](http://amazon.com/skills).

## About
**Note:** The rest of this readme assumes you have your developer environment ready to go and that you have some familiarity with CLI (Command Line Interface) Tools, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), and the [ASK Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit). If not, [click here](./instructions/0-intro.md) for a more detailed walkthrough.


 
### Usage

```text
Alexa, ask Space Facts for a fact
	>> Here's your fact: A year on Mercury is just 88 days long.
	
Alexa, start Space Facts
```

### Repository Contents
* `/.ask`	- [ASK CLI (Command Line Interface) Configuration](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html)	 
* `/lambda/custom` - Back-End Logic for the Alexa Skill hosted on [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
* `/models` - Voice User Interface and Language Specific Interaction Models
* `/instructions` - Step-by-Step Instructions for Getting Started
* `skill.json`	- [Skill Manifest](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-manifest.html)

## Setup w/ ASK CLI

### Pre-requisites
	
* Node.js (> v4.3)
* Register for an [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* Register for an [Amazon Developer Account](https://developer.amazon.com/)
* Install and Setup [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository.

	```bash
	$ git clone https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-fact/
	```

2. Initiatialize the [ASK CLI](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/quick-start-alexa-skills-kit-command-line-interface.html) by Navigating into the repository and running npm command: `ask init`. Follow the prompts.
	
	```bash
	$ cd skill-sample-nodejs-fact
	$ ask init
	```

3. Install npm dependencies by navigating into the `/lambda` directory and running the npm command: `npm install`

	```bash
	$ cd lambda/custom
	$ npm install
	```


### Deployment

ASK CLI will create the skill and the lambda function for you. The Lambda function will be created in ```us-east-1 (Northern Virginia)``` by default.

1. Deploy the skill and the lambda function in one step by running the following command:

	```bash
	$ ask deploy 
	```

### Testing

1. To test, you need to login to Alexa Developer Console, and enable the "Test" switch on your skill from the "Test" Tab.

2. Simulate verbal interaction with your skill through the command line using the following example:

	```bash
	 $ ask simulate -l en-GB -t "alexa, start space facts"
	 
	 ✓ Simulation created for simulation id: 4a7a9ed8-94b2-40c0-b3bd-fb63d9887fa7
	◡ Waiting for simulation response{
	  "status": "SUCCESSFUL",
	  ...
	 ```
	 
3. Once the "Test" switch is enabled, your skill can be tested on devices associated with the developer account as well. Speak to Alexa from any enabled device, from your browser at [echosim.io](https://echosim.io/welcome), or through your Amazon Mobile App and say :

	```text
	Alexa, start space facts
	```



## Customization

1. ```./skill.json```

   Change the skill name, example phrase, icons, testing instructions etc ...

   Remember than many information are locale-specific and must be changed for each locale (en-GB and en-US)

   See the Skill [Manifest Documentation](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/skill-manifest.html) for more information.

2. ```./lambda/custom/index.js```

   Modify messages, and facts from the source code to customize the skill.

3. ```./models/*.json```

	Change the model defintion to replace the invocation name and the sample phrase for each intent.  Repeat the operation for each locale you are planning to support.
